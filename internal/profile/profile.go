// Package profile is the target-profile seam (PRD-2026-09-10
// architecture-first Part II, AD10–AD14): a project's conventions — naming
// policy, layer layout, DB rules, template set — are profile data, not
// pipeline code. "Any template" is the founding requirement: one Go
// project's db/controller/handler shape is a template, another Go project's
// is a different one, the Python batch is a template plus rules, and .NET
// Core lands as a third profile later (P4/P5, its own PRD).
//
// P0 skeleton: the TargetProfile interface and the registry only — nothing
// consumes it yet (P1 extracts gonav). The interface is deliberately small:
// knobs the A8.3 extraction list proved are single-homed; anything that
// refuses to move cleanly stays gonav-invariant in the profile contract
// rather than forced (P1 review rule, AD14).
package profile

// Profile is one target's conversion conventions. Implementations are
// data-shaped (values over interfaces' behavior) so a new project's
// conventions are config + template assets, not a fork of the pipeline.
// (The Layout surface — layer folder names, service dir — was deleted as
// dead API: no engine read it; the tree shape lives in the plan emitter.
// engine-wiring audit Tier-2.)
