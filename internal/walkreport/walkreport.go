// Package walkreport is the P0 instrument of the walk-faithful deterministic
// controller plan (docs/deterministic-walk-plan.md): it answers "how much of
// this service did we actually convert, and what is still a gap?" without
// changing a single byte of generated output.
//
// Two independent measurements, deliberately kept apart:
//
//   - Coverage: per-function flow coverage, from internal/flow. This is the
//     parser-accuracy guard — it says how much of the C source we UNDERSTAND.
//   - Gap census: every `tuxgo:TODO` in an already-emitted controller tree,
//     bucketed by a stable reason code. This says how much of what we
//     understood we could RENDER.
//
// The gap census reads the emitted .go files as text rather than asking the
// emitter to re-report. That is the whole design: a census derived from the
// generator's own return values would agree with a broken generator for the
// same reason it agreed with a correct one. Reading the artifact means the
// number can only ever describe what was really written to disk.
//
// Nothing here is a converter. It writes one report and mutates no pipeline
// state; it never calls an LLM, so -no-llm applies by construction.
