// This file folds a tpcall's FML op window into the buffer STATE at the call
// line — what TPCall.SendFields/RecvFields carry, and what any future
// service-call inliner has to bind against.
//
// The distinction that makes this a separate concern rather than a filter
// over the op log: an FML buffer is a map, not a stream. Adding a field
// twice leaves one value, deleting a field removes it, and re-freeing a
// buffer empties it. So "the ops before the call" and "the buffer at the
// call" are different questions, and only the second one is safe to bind a
// callee's parameters to — a callee bound to a field the caller deleted, or
// to a field left over from a previous call on a reused buffer, would be
// wired to a value that is not there.
//
// Everything here is a replay in source order over facts the scanner
// already produced, so the result is a pure function of the file: no clock,
// no map iteration, no inference.

// fieldDir selects which op kinds build a buffer's state.
