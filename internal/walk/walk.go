// Package walk is the endpoint-wide provenance index for the deterministic
// controller synthesizer.
//
// The shaping renderer (internal/gen) is handed one read at a time and asked
// to satisfy the endpoint's whole response from it. That question has no
// answer in general: a response field is a write to one specific host
// variable, and that host is produced by exactly one read — or by none. Asking
// read B about a field that read A produces can only ever return "no match",
// which is why the same response fields were reported unmapped once per read
// in the endpoint instead of once.
//
// Scope answers the question the renderer actually needs: given the host a
// response write read from, which read produces it?
//
// It is deliberately a pure index over facts that already exist. It resolves
// nothing itself and renders nothing; it says which read owns a host, or that
// none does. Deciding what to emit from that — a row reference, a request
// copy, or a loud gap — stays with the renderer.
