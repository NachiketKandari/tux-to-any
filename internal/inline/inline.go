// Package inline resolves cross-file fn_* helpers and materializes their
// definitions into the calling file, so the existing single-file machinery
// handles them as helpers the caller always owned.
//
// Why append rather than expand at the call site: an fn_* call is an
// EXPRESSION — `if(fn_check(a, &flg) == -1)`. Replacing an expression with
// a statement sequence means hoisting statements out of whatever encloses
// it (an if header, a for condition, a + operand), which is a real C-to-C
// transformation with real evaluation-order and control-flow hazards.
// C function scope is per-function, so appending a whole definition cannot
// collide with the caller's locals at all: the hazards never arise. And
// because the appended text lands below the caller's last line, every line
// number the caller's IR already carries — StartLine, EndLine, Condition
// spans, ExternalFn.Callsites, tpcall windows — stays exactly where it was.
//
// Appending also lands the feature on machinery that already ships. The
// re-folded IR sees each helper as locally defined and locally called,
// which is precisely the shape plan.Build turns into a fixed-signature
// KindFnHelper unit and convert.rewriteHelperCalls rewrites to a
// `s.<GoName>(...)` call from the generated controller. The helper's body
// lands in controller/fns.go, called by the main controller only.
//
// Determinism is the design constraint throughout: identical inputs produce
// byte-identical output. The frontier is a FIFO queue seeded from the
// caller's externals in sorted-name order, callee resolution reuses ir's
// first-wins corpus table, and nothing consults the clock, a map iteration
// order, or an LLM. A callee that cannot be resolved is never guessed — it
// stays an ExternalFn and keeps the plan layer's existing stub policy, and
// every refusal is recorded in Result.Skipped rather than dropped.
