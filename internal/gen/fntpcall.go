// TPCallNotRendered is the reason code for a tpcall site the deterministic
// path does not render. One is emitted per site.
//
// It exists because the alternative was worse than silence. The tpcall
// placeholder path (internal/convert renderTPCallPlaceholders) is
// entry-scoped: it reads plan.KindTPCall units, and plan builds those from
// the entry service's own tpcalls. The corpus entry SVC_RISK_PRFL has zero
// tpcalls — both of the file's tpcalls live inside fn helpers. So the
// placeholder never fired, and a tpcall reached the emitted tree as nothing
// at all: no call, no TODO, no reason code. A reader of the generated Go
// could not tell that a call to another service had been dropped.
//
// Option B of the tpcall decision would render these; it is deferred
// (docs/deterministic-walk-plan.md, "Pinned: TPCall is Option A"). Until
// then they are counted.

// flow tree instead of grepping the source.

// This is the part of Option A that carries the weight. A tpcall is how the
// callee's data arrives; a helper that skips it has not done its work. But
// the generated callers test the legacy status convention — `== -1` for
// failure — so returning the legacy SUCCESS value lets execution walk straight
// past the check. In the corpus that path ends at
// UpdateRpdRiskProfileDevationq59, which writes the risk profile to the
// database: a stub that silently succeeds and persists data it never fetched
// is worse than no stub at all.
//
// So any helper with an unrendered tpcall returns the failure status. That is
// deliberately uniform across helpers whether or not their SQL also rendered:
// the caller cannot tell which part ran, and partial work reported as success
// is the failure mode being closed.
