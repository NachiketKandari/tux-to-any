// ControlFlowNotRendered is the reason code for a legacy control-flow
// construct inside a fn helper that the deterministic path cannot yet
// project. It is counted by internal/walkreport.
//
// The alternative was to keep rendering helper bodies as a flat statement
// list, which is what made a 200-line legacy function come out as three
// statements that looked complete. Silence is the failure mode; a counted
// gap is not.

// CallOutsideItsGuard is the reason code for a call that the deterministic
// path emitted unconditionally even though the legacy source guarded it.
//
// It is a separate code from ControlFlowNotRendered because it is a strictly
// worse defect: an unrendered branch is missing work, whereas a call hoisted
// out of its guard asserts something the source does not — the emitted Go
// says "always", the C says "when c_flg_using == 'A'". A reader of the Go
// would be misled about behaviour, not merely left without detail. Counting

// hints describe a rendering rather than a disappearance:
//
//   - HintFetchIterate: "cursor fetch loop → one multi-row store call +
//     range over rows" — the loop must become a range. Until it does, an
//     omitted fetch loop is missing work.
//   - HintDoWhile: "do-while → Go for {} with a trailing break check" —
//     likewise; the loop must become a for.
//
// Treating those as elidable would be the exact smoothing-over this project
// forbids: the hint would license a gap that no code has yet filled. The
// four below are the ones whose detail text says the construct itself goes
// away.
